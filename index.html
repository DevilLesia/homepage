					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>John Winston Lennon was famously shot to death at age 40, midway through his tumultuous life and storied career, robbing the world of a towering talent and profoundly ambiguous personality.<br>

During the four-plus decades following his unimaginably tragic and senseless demise, much of Lennon’s legacy has become reduced and calcified. For many of the insufferable, apparently unkillable Baby Boomers, Lennon’s death became a convenient excuse for a modified beatification — forever casting him as a kind of petrified Summer Of Love saint, a bespectacled avatar of pacifism and righteous liberal causes. It wouldn’t feel so egregious if the actual John Lennon were not a man so completely oppositional in terms of temperament.<br>

The real Lennon was by turns generous and cruel, ingenious and indulgent, scolding and excessive. His politics were a muddled concoction of radicalism and reactionary impulses.</p>

					<h2>The Beatles</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">1960 - 1969</p>
					<p>He was the Beatles unquestionable leader, ruling as much through intimidation as ability. That is not to suggest that his ability was less than awesome — arguably no figure in the rock and roll tradition has ever manifested an equal combination of writing and vocal talent, save perhaps his early hero Chuck Berry. A restless and searching spirit led Lennon down countless musical roads, setting the template for the Beatles experimentations and functionally inventing psychedelia on the fly. Still and to his death, he remained an avowed descendant of Elvis Presley and Sam Cooke, Carl Perkins and Little Richard. Lennon’s twinned and simultaneous devotion to extreme progressiveness and nostalgic traditionalism is a paradox that informed both his art and life.</p>

					<h2>Creation/Glory</h2>
					<p>Lennon was raised as an Anglican and attended Dovedale Primary School. After passing his eleven-plus exam, he attended Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool from September 1952 to 1957, and was described by Harvey at the time as a "happy-go-lucky, good-humoured, easy going, lively lad". He often drew comical cartoons that appeared in his own self-made school magazine called The Daily Howl, but despite his artistic talent, his school reports were damning: "Certainly on the road to failure ... hopeless ... rather a clown in class ... wasting other pupils' time."</p>

					<p>At age 15, Lennon formed the skiffle group, the Quarrymen. Named after Quarry Bank High School, the group was established by Lennon in September 1956. By the summer of 1957, the Quarrymen played a "spirited set of songs" made up of half skiffle and half rock and roll.Lennon first met Paul McCartney at the Quarrymen's second performance, which was held in Woolton on 6 July at the St. Peter's Church garden fête. Lennon then asked McCartney to join the band.</p>
